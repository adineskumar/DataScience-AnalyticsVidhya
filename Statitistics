Statistics is all about data

Descriptive statistics  -- Organizing, summarizing, describing the details
                        -- Then we get the Inferential details about the data
                        
                        
Central Tendency also called means -->  Average or Middle or Arithmetic Mean
                 --   Example :
                      4 3 1 6 1 7
                 Mean = (4+3+1+6+1+7)/6 = 22/6      = 3.6
                 Median = 1 1 3 4 6 7   = (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5
                 Mode   = Most Common Number (1 1 3 4 6 7) = 1
                 
                 
variablilty:
--------------
  -- from  the data, we could describe and find the data pattern ( if the data is similar/different )
  -- Example : Carrots from a particular field will be of same size, whereas from the other fields, the size may not be uniform
               Colors might be similar or varied
               
  -- We can find the variablility as below
  -- Consider Staff A and Staff B and their working hours
  
  Staff A               Staff B
  -------               -------
  8.5                   12
  10                    5
  8                     14
  9                     6
  9.5                   8
  
  -- From the above data, if you use central tendency we will not be able to find the pattern correctly as below
  -- Staff A --> Mean (8.5 + 10 + 8 + 9 + 9.5)/5 = 9
  -- Staff B --> Mean (12 + 5 + 14 + 6 + 8)/5    = 9
  
  -- If we look up, mean is same, but it does not show us the variablilty in the data
