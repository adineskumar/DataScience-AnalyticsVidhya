Statistics is all about data

Descriptive statistics  -- Organizing, summarizing, describing the details
                        -- Then we get the Inferential details about the data
                        
                        
Central Tendency -->  Average or Middle or Arithmetic Mean
                 --   Example :
                      4 3 1 6 1 7
                 Mean = (4+3+1+6+1+7)/6 = 22/6      = 3.6
                 Median = 1 1 3 4 6 7   = (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5
                 Mode   = Most Common Number (1 1 3 4 6 7 ) = 1
